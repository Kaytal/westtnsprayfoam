  <h2>The How and Why!</h2>
  <div class="extra-info">
    <p>Everyone knows that when your space isn’t properly insulated you are heating/cooling in excess.  Therefore you are literally throwing money out the window or, more metaphorically, you are throwing money out through the gaps in your insulation.</p>
    <p>The common way to insulate large spaces up to now has always been to buy rolls of fiberglass/wool insulation batts.  These are then placed in between studs and you drywall around them. This doesn’t create an airtight seal.  Therefore you are losing the heat/cooling YOU paid for.</p>
    <p>Spray foam applications offer a much more added value.  Modern consumers are looking for better, more energy efficient ways of heating/cooling.  The best way to do this is to not waste the energy they are already expending to heat/cool.  Spray foam is inexpensive, quick to be applied, and lasts much longer than traditional insulation.</p>
